      "summary": "AXS Investments has launched single-stock ETFs, including the AXS TSLA Bear Daily ETF (TSLQ), which allows investors to short Tesla. However, the article highlights that these ETFs are a \"mind-numbingly dumb\" and \"very risky\" investment due to exorbitant expense ratios (1.15%), daily resets leading to chronic underperformance, and a lack of diversification. The author warns that shorting Tesla via TSLQ is likely to result in chronic underperformance and significant losses over time despite its intended purpose.",
