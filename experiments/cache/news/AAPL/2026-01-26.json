While this concentration has driven substantial gains over the past five years, it also creates significant vulnerability during market downturns, as demonstrated by OEF's recent underperformance compared to the broader S&P 500 ETF. OEF is best suited for investors seeking amplified exposure to large-cap U.S. equities with a growth tilt, who are comfortable with the inherent concentration risk.",
