      "summary": "Apple's App Store experienced its steepest year-on-year net revenue decline in September, dropping 5% according to Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring, largely due to a 14% plunge in gaming revenue. Sensor Tower data supports this, showing Apple's September revenue at $6.9 billion, down from $7.2 billion last year, and Morgan Stanley attributes this trend to consumers reallocating discretionary income amidst a global economic downturn. Despite a predicted potential rebound in the December quarter due to an extra selling week and currency fluctuations, Apple's services revenue for the September-ending quarter also fell short of Wall Street expectations.",
