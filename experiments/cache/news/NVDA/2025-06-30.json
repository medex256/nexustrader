However, investors are cautioned due to Cyngn's early commercialization stage, with Q1 revenue of only $47,200, significant losses, high cash burn, and a stretched valuation with a P/S ratio of 43.5. The recent rally is largely speculative, driven by Nvidia's mention rather than fundamental business strength or an exclusive partnership.",
