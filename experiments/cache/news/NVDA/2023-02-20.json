      "summary": "This article analyzes the current hype surrounding generative AI, using the iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (XT) as a proxy for innovation. It proposes a spread trade—long on CME Micro E-Mini Nasdaq Futures (MNQ) and short on XT—to capitalize on the expected normalization after the initial hype cycle, aiming for a 1.49x reward-to-risk ratio. The strategy is designed to generate alpha by neutralizing beta in an uncertain market.",
