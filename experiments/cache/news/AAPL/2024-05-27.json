      "summary": "Apple Inc. announced a significant $110 billion stock buyback plan, prompting Poole College finance professor Richard Warr to explain the rationale behind such corporate actions. Warr details why companies conduct buybacks, including investing extra cash, buying undervalued stock, restoring share value, and tweaking the debt-equity balance.
