      "title": "XLV vs. XLK: Time to Rotate Into Healthcare?",
      "summary": "This article examines whether it's time for investors to rotate from high-performing technology stocks (XLK) into the underperforming, yet defensive, healthcare sector (XLV). It highlights the significant divergence in performance, with tech surging while healthcare lagged, and discusses factors like stretched valuations in tech and the defensive nature of healthcare, especially given an aging population and consistent demand for services. Despite political rhetoric, the article suggests that healthcare offers compelling long-term exposure and a potential tactical opportunity for rebalancing portfolios.",
