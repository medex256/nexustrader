      "summary": "The article analyzes the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ), which offers an 11.52% dividend yield by selling covered calls on Nasdaq-100 stocks. While providing high monthly income, JEPQ significantly caps upside capital appreciation compared to growth-focused ETFs like QQQ, essentially trading 10-12 percentage points of annual total return for its yield. The fund's distributions also fluctuate greatly, making it less predictable for budgeting, and its high tech concentration and portfolio turnover present specific risks.",
