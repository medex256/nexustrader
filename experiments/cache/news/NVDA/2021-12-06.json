      "title": "U.S. FTC sues to block Nvidia deal to buy Arm",
      "summary": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued to block Nvidia Corp's more than $80 billion acquisition of British chip technology provider Arm, citing concerns that the deal would give Nvidia undue control over crucial computing technology and designs. This move complicates an already challenging regulatory path for the acquisition, which has faced opposition from the chip industry and scrutiny from British and European Union regulators. The FTC argues the merger would harm competition, reduce innovation, and lead to higher prices by giving Nvidia the ability and incentive to undermine competitors who rely on Arm's technology.",
