      "summary": "An arbitration tribunal has sided with Johnson & Johnson on two key issues in its royalty dispute with Genmab over the blockbuster multiple myeloma drug Darzalex. J&J will pay royalties only through Genmab's last-held patent, not J&J's own, and can reduce royalty payments to Genmab to offset its obligations to Halozyme for drug delivery technology used in Darzalex Faspro. This decision follows J&J scaling back its payments in 2020, costing Genmab approximately $73.16 million to date.",
