      "title": "Netflix stock has now lost all its gains from the pandemic",
      "summary": "Netflix's stock has lost all its gains from the pandemic, with shares falling to a 52-week low of around $332 and being more than 50% down from its mid-November high of $700.99. This decline is attributed to consumers returning to out-of-home entertainment, increased competition from other streaming platforms, and underwhelming subscriber growth forecasts, prompting Netflix to rethink its strategy and raise prices. Analyst Michael Pachter suggests that competition makes it harder to retain customers and increases content costs, while competitors are less likely to license content to Netflix now that they have their own platforms.",
