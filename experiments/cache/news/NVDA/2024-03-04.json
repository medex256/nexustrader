      "title": "Nvidia skyrocketed over the past 5 years, but 3 stocks performed even better—and none is Apple or Tesla",
      "summary": "While Nvidia has achieved an impressive 1,904% return over the past five years, three mid-cap stocks have significantly outpaced it: e.l.f. Beauty (2,491%), Super Micro Computer (4,175%), and Celsius Holdings (over 5,300%). The article highlights that smaller companies (mid-caps) often show greater growth potential and less media coverage than large-cap stocks like Nvidia, suggesting diversification into these smaller companies can boost long-term returns. Investors are advised to use diversified funds (ETFs and mutual funds) to mitigate volatility and risk associated with individual small-cap stock picks.",
