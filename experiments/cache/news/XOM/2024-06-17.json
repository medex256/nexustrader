      "title": "Oil market dynamics: The calm after the storm",
      "summary": "Brent crude oil prices have eased to $78 per barrel in early June, down from over $90 in April, influenced by subdued demand, increased inventories, and easing geopolitical risks. The World Bank projects oil prices to average $84 per barrel in 2024, with potential risks including escalating conflicts, lower-than-expected North American supply, and weaker global GDP growth. Global oil supply is expected to reach a record high in 2024 due to non-OPEC+ producers, while OPEC+ production is forecast to decline, yet increase in 2025 as cuts are phased out.",

      "summary": "ConocoPhillips announced its acquisition of Marathon Oil for $22.5 billion, marking the latest in a series of multibillion-dollar energy deals. While the Biden administration has increased antitrust scrutiny, experts believe this merger is less likely to face regulatory challenges compared to larger acquisitions like Exxon's due to the relative size of the companies and the absence of downstream assets.
